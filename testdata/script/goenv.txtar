# Unfortunately, due to https://go.dev/issue/22315, cp + exec is racy.
# Since we run multiple test scripts in parallel as goroutines,
# if one thread performs a cp while another is forking, the other may keep the
# file open slightly longer than we think, causing the fork to fail due to the
# file still being open for writing.
# Until the root problem is fixed, add a sleep to try to make that narrow window
# of time less likely to cause problems.
# TODO(mvdan): remove the sleeps once cp + exec isn't racy anymore.

# We need to properly quote the path to garble for toolexec.
# If we don't, characters like spaces or quotes will result in errors.
# EXEC_PATH is the test binary's os.Executable.
# Copying it to a path with basename "garble" makes testscript run our main func.
# Note that double quotes are not allowed in Windows filenames.
