# A fairly average Go build, importing some std libraries.
# We always build for a foreign GOOS.
# GOOS=windows, unless the host is also windows; then linux.
# GOARCH=arm, unless the host is also arm; then amd64.
# Windows and ARM are both interesting,
# and it helps with coverage as we mainly test on linux/amd64.
#
# We also ensure that intrinsics work as expected.
# The compiler replaces calls to some functions with intrinsics in its ssa stage,
# and it recognizes which functions via the package path and func name.
# If we obfuscate those package paths without adjusting the compiler,
# intrinsics aren't applied, causing performance loss or build errors.
# We use the math/bits package, as its Len64 intrinsic is present in both arm
# and arm64, and it is not part of the runtime nor its dependencies.

stderr 'intrinsic substitution for Len64.*BitLen64'

# As a last step, also test building for MacOS if we're not already on it.
# We already cover Windows and Linux above, and MacOS is the other major OS.
# The way it is implemented in the standard library, in particular with syscalls,
# is different enough that it sometimes causes special bugs.
