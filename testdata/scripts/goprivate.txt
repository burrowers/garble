# Try garbling all of std, given some std packages.
# No need for a main package here; building the std packages directly works the
# same, and is faster as we don't need to link a binary.
# This used to cause multiple errors, mainly since std vendors some external
# packages so we must properly support ImportMap.
# Plus, some packages like net make heavy use of complex features like Cgo.
# Note that we won't obfuscate a few std packages just yet, mainly those around runtime.

# support ImportMap when linking.

# Also check that a full rebuild is reproducible,
# with -a to rebuild all packages.
# This is slow, but necessary to uncover bugs hidden by the build cache.
