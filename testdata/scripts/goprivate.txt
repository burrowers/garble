# same, and is faster as we don't need to link a binary.
# This used to cause multiple errors, mainly since std vendors some external
# packages so we must properly support ImportMap.
# Plus, some packages like net make heavy use of complex features like Cgo.
# Note that we won't obfuscate a few std packages just yet, mainly those around runtime.
