# Changelog

## [v0.12.1] - 2024-02-18

This bugfix release fixes a regression in v0.12.0 that broke `x/sys/unix`.
See #830.

## [v0.12.0] - 2024-02-10

This release continues support for Go 1.21 and includes fixes for Go 1.22,
now that the final 1.22.0 release is out.

@lu4p improved the detection of types used with reflection to track `make` calls too,
fixing more `cannot use T1 as T2` errors when obfuscating types. See [#690].

@pagran added a trash block generator to the control flow obfuscator.
See [#825].

A number of bugfixes are also included:
* Avoid an error when building for `GOOS=ios` - [#816]
* Prevent the shuffle literal obfuscation from being optimized away - [#819]
* Support inline comments in assembly `#include` lines - [#812]

## [v0.11.0] - 2023-12-02

This release drops support for Go 1.20, continues support for Go 1.21,
and adds initial support for the upcoming Go 1.22.

@lu4p and @mvdan improved the code using SSA to detect which types are used with reflection,
which should fix a number of errors such as `cannot use T1 as T2` or `cannot convert T1 to T2`.
See: [#685], [#763], [#782], [#785], [#807].

@pagran added experimental support for control flow obfuscation,
which should provide stronger obfuscation of function bodies when enabled.
See the documentation at [docs/CONTROLFLOW.md](https://github.com/burrowers/garble/blob/master/docs/CONTROLFLOW.md).
See [#462].

A number of bugfixes are also included:

* Avoid panicking on a struct embedding a builtin alias - [#798]
* Strip struct field tags when hashing struct types for type identity - [#801]

## [v0.10.1] - 2023-06-25

This bugfix release continues support for Go 1.20 and the upcoming 1.21,
and features:

* Avoid obfuscating local types used for reflection, like in `go-spew` - #765

## [v0.10.0] - 2023-06-05

This release drops support for Go 1.19, continues support for Go 1.20,
and adds initial support for the upcoming Go 1.21.

@lu4p rewrote the code to detect whether `reflect` is used on each Go type,
which is used to decide which Go types should not be obfuscated to prevent breakage.
The old code analyzed syntax trees with type information, which is cheap but clumsy.
The new code uses SSA, which adds a bit of CPU cost to builds, but allows for a
more powerful analysis that is less likely to break on edge cases.
While this change does slow down builds slightly, we will start using SSA for more
features in the near term, such as control flow obfuscation. See [#732].

@pagran improved the patching of Go's linker to also obfuscate funcInfo.entryoff,
making it harder to relate a function's metadata with its body in the binary. See [#641].

@mvdan rewrote garble's caching to be more robust, avoiding errors such as
"cannot load garble export file". The new caching system is entirely separate
from Go's `GOCACHE`, being placed in `GARBLE_CACHE`, which defaults to a directory
such as `~/.cache/garble`. See [#708].

@DominicBreuker taught `-literals` to support obfuscating large string literals
by using the "simple" obfuscator on them, as it runs in linear time. See [#720].

@mvdan added support for `garble run`, the obfuscated version of `go run`,
to quickly test that a main program still works when obfuscated. See [#661].

A number of bugfixes are also included:

* Ensure that `sync/atomic` types are still aligned by the compiler - [#686]
* Print the chosen random seed when using `-seed=random` - [#696]
* Avoid errors in `git apply` if the system language isn't English - [#698]
* Avoid a panic when importing a missing package - [#694]
* Suggest a command when asking the user to rebuild garble - [#739]

## [v0.9.3] - 2023-02-12

This bugfix release continues support for Go 1.19 and 1.20, and features:

* Support inline comments in assembly to fix `GOARCH=ppc64` - [#672]
* Avoid obfuscating `reflect.Value` to fix `davecgh/go-spew` - [#676]
* Fix runtime panics when using `garble build` inside a VCS directory - [#675]

## [v0.9.2] - 2023-02-07

This bugfix release continues support for Go 1.19 and 1.20, and features:

* Support `go:linkname` directives referencing methods - [#656]
* Fix more "unused import" errors with `-literals` - [#658]

## [v0.9.1] - 2023-01-26

This bugfix release continues support for Go 1.19 and the upcoming Go 1.20,
and features:

* Support obfuscating code which uses "dot imports" - [#610]
* Fix linking errors for MIPS architectures - [#646]
* Compiler intrinsics for packages like `math/bits` work again - [#655]

## [v0.9.0] - 2023-01-17

This release continues support for Go 1.19 and the upcoming Go 1.20.

Noteworthy changes include:

* Randomize the magic number header in `pclntab` - [#622]
* Further reduce binary sizes with `-tiny` by 4%  - [#633]
* Reduce the size overhead of all builds by 2% - [#629]
* Reduce the binary size overhead of `-literals` by 20%  - [#637]
* Support assembly references to the current package name - [#619]
* Support package paths with periods in assembly - [#621]

Note that the first two changes are done by patching and rebuilding Go's linker.
While this adds complexity, it enables more link time obfuscation.

## [v0.8.0] - 2022-12-15

This release drops support for Go 1.18, continues support for Go 1.19,
and adds initial support for the upcoming Go 1.20.

* `GOPRIVATE` is no longer used, being deprecated in [v0.5.0]
* Obfuscate assembly source code filenames - [#605]
* Randomize the lengths of obfuscated names
* Support obfuscating `time` and `syscall`
