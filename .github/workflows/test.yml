# Note that a full "go test" is quite heavy,
# as it runs many builds under the hood.
# The default -timeout=10m can be hit by the hosted runners.
#
# Also note that we don't use actions/cache for Go on purpose.
# Caching GOMODCACHE wouldn't help much, as we have few deps.
# Caching GOCACHE would do more harm than good,
# as the tests redo most of their work if the garble version changes,
# and the majority of commits or PRs will do so.
