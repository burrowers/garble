# Note that a full "go test" is quite heavy,
# as it runs many builds under the hood.
# The default -timeout=10m can be hit by the hosted runners.
#
# Also note that we don't use Actions caching for Go on purpose.
# Caching GOMODCACHE wouldn't help much, as we have few deps.
# Caching GOCACHE would do more harm than good,
# as the tests redo most of their work if the garble version changes,
# and the majority of commits or PRs will do so.
# Moreover, GitHub saves and restores caches via compressed archives over the
# network, which means it can easily add one minute of overhead on its own for
# just a few hundred megabytes worth of files.
